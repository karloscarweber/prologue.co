		<p>Let’s be Honest here. You want to make an app. maybe it’s a cooking app, or a To-Do List app. Maybe you want to tap your phone to hear the perfect fart noise. whatever it is you have 1 problem, You don’t know how to program. That’s where I come in.</p>

		<p>You see, I know how to program. What’s more, I know how to make apps. So that’s what I’m going to teach you, how to make apps. You’re going to learn how to program with Swift, Apple’s new programming language. It’s easier for beginners to learn Swift than Objective-C, which is what the Grizzled Ancients used to make ancient apps.</p>

		<p>If you don’t know how to program at all, or if you just don’t know how to program Swift. This book is made for complete beginners, but even the Pros need a refresher once in a while.</p>
