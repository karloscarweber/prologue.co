			<h2>Danny wanted to learn to do what I do.</h2>

			<p>My Sister in Law Danny said to herself that if I can learn to program and make apps, then she can do it too. So she ponied up the dough for a little MacBook Air and started studying. </p>

			<p>Since Swift was announced we decided to write a book together, just for beginners. So that’s what we’re doing. Together we offer two perspectives, One from an experienced programmer, Another from a complete beginner.</p>

			<h2>Learn by building real apps.</h2>

			<p>We believe that the best way to learn something new is to put it into practice. By the end of the course you’ll have more than just experience, you will have working examples of apps you’ve built.</p>

			<p>Programming is like building with Lego, each brick fits into another in exactly the right way. Once you understand how to put the pieces together you won't have anything to stop you. </p>

			<h2>This course is for beginners.</h2>

			<p>No experience is required. Nothing. If you’ve never coded anything in your life, or if you have never opened a text editor before, you will learn to make apps. We understand that programming is confusing and weird, it’s just weird. We’ll walk you through the process. We’ll make certain that you don’t get lost. </p>

					<p><strong>How many Pages are in the book?</strong></p>

					<p><strong>What is Kow.fm</strong></p>
					<p>Hi, I’m karl. Kow.fm is home to my personal site, my blog, and my podcast. I’ve been interviewing creative professionals to find and share their stories of learning something new, and what it takes to succeed at it. All of this to support you, the beginner.</p>

				</div>
				<div>					

					<p><strong>Who are the Authors?</strong></p>
					<p>Karl Weber &amp; Danny Lopez, We kick lots of butt.</p>

					<p><strong>What additions are planned?</strong></p>
					<p>We’ll be taking our best blog posts and tutorials to turn them into full fledged apps, that we’ll teach you to build in the book. New chapters are added to the book as needed and are included with your purchase.</p>

					<p><strong>Will there be any code samples.</strong></p>
					<p>Yes, lots. You’ll be able to see a snapshot of every app as we go through the process of building it from scratch. Thoughtful and useful comments will be found in all the code to guide you if you’re more of a mimc learner.</p>
