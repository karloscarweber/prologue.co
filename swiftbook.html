				<p>It seems like every programming book ever expects you to already know how to program before you can use their book. “Basic Programming Experience Required” Is the most alienating sentence to read in a programming book.</p>

				<p>We don’t believe in that, so that’s why we wrote Swift Foundations, We’ll teach you everything you need to know to make your first app, NO Programming Experience Required.</p>

				<p>This book will focus on teaching you the fundamentals of the Swift Programming Language by building two real, ready to release apps. By the end you’ll have the skills you need to make fantastic apps.</p>

			<h2>Danny wanted to learn to do what I do.</h2>

			<p>My Sister Danny said that if I can learn to program and make apps, then she can do it too. So she ponied up the dough for a little MacBook Air and started studying. Together We started Prologue productions so that we could publish apps together.</p>

			<p>Swift is a brand new programming language from apple, everyone is a beginner with swift. There aren’t any books teaching Swift for beginners, So we wrote the very first book. </p>

			<p>Together we offer two perspectives, One from an experienced programmer, Another from a complete beginner. This gives the book useful insights not commonly found in programming books, and will make it especially easy for a beginner to pick up and learn.</p>

			<h2>Learn by building real apps.</h2>

			<p>We believe that the best way to learn something new is to put it into practice. By the end of the course you’ll have more than just experience, you will have working examples of apps you’ve built.</p>

			<p>Both of these apps will be built, polished, and ready for release by the end of the book.</p>

			<p>Programming is like building with Lego, each brick fits into another in exactly the right way. Once you understand how to put the pieces together you won't have anything to stop you.</p>

			<h2>This course is for beginners.</h2>

			<p>No experience is required. Nothing. If you’ve never coded anything in your life, or if you have never opened a text editor before, you will learn to make apps. We understand that programming is confusing and weird, it’s just weird. We’ll walk you through the process. We’ll make certain that you don’t get lost. </p>

			<h2>Facts &amp; Stuff.</h2>

			<div class="elastic">
				<div>

					<p><strong>How many Pages are in the book?</strong></p>
					<p>The book will be about 250 pages, give or take. The real value comes in how it is presented</p>

					<p><strong>What's in the Blog?</strong></p>
					<p>Every week or so we release a new blog post teaching something new that we have learned, or Trouble topics in iOS.</p>

					<p><strong>What is Kow.fm</strong></p>
					<p>Hi, I’m karl. Kow.fm is home to my personal site, my blog, and my podcast. I’ve been interviewing creative professionals to find and share their stories of learning something new, and what it takes to succeed at it. All of this to support you, the beginner.</p>

					<p><strong>What's with the Request a tutorial thing?</strong></p>
					<p>We realize that A book about Swift that teaches you to make a calculator isn't going to cover what Students REALLY want to learn to do. It will give you the experience and confidence necessary to move forward.</p> 

					<p>Pick an app that you want to learn to make and we'll do our best to not only make the core of the app, but to write an awesome tutorial teaching you how to do the same thing. When it's ready and polished we'll give the tutorial to everyone else who bought the book for free. Awesome. </p>

				</div>
				<div>

					<p><strong>Who are the Authors?</strong></p>
					<p>Karl Weber &amp; Danny Lopez, We kick lots of butt.</p>

					<p><strong>What additions are planned?</strong></p>
					<p>We’ll be taking our best blog posts and tutorials to turn them into full fledged apps, that we’ll teach you to build in the book. New chapters are added to the book as needed and are included with your purchase.</p>

					<p><strong>Will there be any code samples.</strong></p>
					<p>Yes, lots. You’ll be able to see a snapshot of every app as we go through the process of building it from scratch. Thoughtful and useful comments will be found in all the code to guide you if you’re more of a mimc learner.</p>

					<p><strong>What if I don't like it?</strong></p>
					<p>We will refund your money. Straight up. We would appreciate feedback too. If you feel like there is something missing from the book that should be there, Send us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@prologue.co">hello@prologue.co</a> and We'll work with you to get it into the book.</p>
