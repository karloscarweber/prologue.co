			<p>We’ll teach you everything you need to know to make your first app, <strong>NO Programming Experience Required</strong>.</p>

			<p>We focus on the foundations of the Swift Programming Language by building a real, ready to release app named <em>Stand To Make</em>. By the end you’ll have the skills you need to learn the to build the pieces that interest you. Programming is like playing with <em>Lego</em>, We build piece by piece. Most programming courses move from topic to topic too quickly to truly teach the basics. We focus on the basics of programming and the bare essentials to make an iPhone app, but we delve deep into those basics to build a solid foundation for future sucess. </p>

			<p>This book is small and focused as beginning courses should be. </p>

			<h2>Programming from Scratch</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="single marketing-text">
			<p>I understand that learning to program is difficult. It was hard for me! but it doesn't have to be as hard for you. Learning the basics of programming shouldn't be like searching for every piece of the <strong>Triforce</strong> from <em>the Legend of Zelda</em>. I'll walk you through the basics of Swift Programming so that you don't get lost, and help you to understand the important elements of programming.</p>

			<p>Swift is a brand new programming language from apple, everyone is a beginner with swift. There aren’t any books teaching Swift for beginners, So I wanted to write one.</p>

			<h2>Danny wanted to learn to do what I do.</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="single marketing-text">
			<p>My Sister Danny said that if I can learn to program and make apps, then she can do it too. So she ponied up the dough for a little MacBook Air and started studying. Together We started <em>Prologue productions</em> so that we could publish apps together.</p>

			<p>Swift is a brand new programming language from apple, everyone is a beginner with swift. There aren’t any books teaching Swift for beginners, So we wrote the very first book. </p>

			<p>Together we offer two perspectives, One from an experienced programmer, Another from a complete beginner. This gives the book useful insights not commonly found in programming books, and will make it especially easy for a beginner to pick up and learn.</p>

			<h2>Facts &amp; Stuff.</h2>

			<div class="elastic">
				<div>

					<p><strong>How many Pages are in the book?</strong></p>
					<p>The book will be about 250 pages, give or take. The real value comes in how it is presented</p>

					<p><strong>What's in the Blog?</strong></p>
					<p>Every week or so we release a new blog post teaching something new that we have learned, or Trouble topics in iOS.</p>

					<p><strong>What is Kow.fm</strong></p>
					<p>Hi, I’m karl. Kow.fm is home to my personal site, my blog, and my podcast. I’ve been interviewing creative professionals to find and share their stories of learning something new, and what it takes to succeed at it. All of this to support you, the beginner.</p>

					<p><strong>What's with the Request a tutorial thing?</strong></p>
					<p>We realize that A book about Swift that teaches you to make a calculator isn't going to cover what Students REALLY want to learn to do. It will give you the experience and confidence necessary to move forward.</p> 

					<p>Pick an app that you want to learn to make and we'll do our best to not only make the core of the app, but to write an awesome tutorial teaching you how to do the same thing. When it's ready and polished we'll give the tutorial to everyone else who bought the book for free. Awesome. </p>

				</div>
				<div>

					<p><strong>Who are the Authors?</strong></p>
					<p>Karl Weber &amp; Danny Lopez, We kick lots of butt.</p>

					<p><strong>What additions are planned?</strong></p>
					<p>We’ll be taking our best blog posts and tutorials to turn them into full fledged apps, that we’ll teach you to build in the book. New chapters are added to the book as needed and are included with your purchase.</p>

					<p><strong>Will there be any code samples.</strong></p>
					<p>Yes, lots. You’ll be able to see a snapshot of every app as we go through the process of building it from scratch. Thoughtful and useful comments will be found in all the code to guide you if you’re more of a mimc learner.</p>

					<p><strong>What if I don't like it?</strong></p>
					<p>We will refund your money. Straight up. We would appreciate feedback too. If you feel like there is something missing from the book that should be there, Send us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@prologue.co">hello@prologue.co</a> and We'll work with you to get it into the book.</p>
