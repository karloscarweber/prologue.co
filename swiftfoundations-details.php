			<h2>A step by step guide for beginners</h2>
			<p>I’ll teach you everything you need to know to make your first app, <strong>NO Programming Experience Required</strong>. The Book is almost ready and needs some well deserved feedback. Get the first 2 Chapters for Free.</p>

			<p>We focus on the foundations of the Swift Programming Language by building a real, ready to release app named <em>Stand To Make</em>. By the end you’ll have the skills you need to build the pieces that interest you. Programming is like playing with <em>Lego</em>, We build piece by piece. Most programming courses move from topic to topic too quickly to truly teach the basics. We focus on the basics of programming and the bare essentials to make an iPhone app, but we delve deep into those basics to build a solid foundation for future success. </p>

			<p>This book is small and focused as beginning courses should be. </p>

			<h2>Programming from Scratch</h2>
		
			<p>I understand that learning to program is difficult. It was hard for me! but it doesn't have to be as hard for you. Learning the basics of programming shouldn't be like searching for every piece of the <strong>Triforce</strong> from <em>the Legend of Zelda</em>. I'll walk you through the basics of Swift Programming so that you don't get lost, and help you to understand the important elements of programming.</p>

				<div>

					<p><strong>What's with this Beta thing?</strong></p>
					<p><strike>I decided that releasing the book early would allow me to get some feedback on the content of the book and to find early problems. Plus it's available at a discount while in beta which is a pretty slick deal.</strike> The Beta sale is over, the rest of the book should arrive before thanksgiving.</p>

					<p><strong>When will the rest of the book be ready?</strong></p>
					<p>A couple Weeks. The whole book will be ready and released by Thanksgiving, Becuase you know on thanksgiving I'm going to be doing nothing but eat turkey.</p>

					<p><strong>How many Pages are in the book?</strong></p>
					<p>The book will be about 200 pages, give or take. The real value comes in how it is presented.</p>

					<p><strong>What is Kow.fm</strong></p>
					<p>Hi, I’m karl. Kow.fm is home to my personal site, my blog, and my podcast. I’ve been interviewing creative professionals to find and share their stories of learning something new, and what it takes to succeed at it. All of this to support you, the beginner.</p>

				</div>
				<div>

					<p><strong>Who is the Author?</strong></p>
					<p>Karl Weber, That's Me.</p>

					<p><strong>What additions are planned?</strong></p>
					<p>Appendices on AutoLayout, CloudKit, AlamoFire, CocoaPods, and a dozen other topics are planned for the book.</p>

					<p><strong>Will there be any code samples.</strong></p>
					<p>Yes, lots. You’ll be able to see a snapshot of the app as we go through the process of building it from scratch. Thoughtful and useful comments will be found in all the code to guide you if you’re more of a mimic learner.</p>
