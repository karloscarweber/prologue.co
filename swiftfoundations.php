				<h2>Swift Foundations<span class="betaflag">beta</span></h2>

				<p>Let’s be Honest here. You want to make an app. maybe it’s a cooking app, or a To-Do List app. Maybe you want to tap your phone to hear the perfect fart noise. whatever it is you have 1 problem, You don’t know how to program. That’s where I come in.</p>

				<p>You see, I know how to program. What’s more, I know how to make apps. So that’s what I’m going to teach you, how to make apps. You’re going to learn how to program with Swift, Apple’s new programming language. It’s easier for beginners to learn Swift than Objective-C, which is what the Grizzled Ancients used to make ancient apps.</p>

				<p>If you don’t know how to program at all, or if you just don’t know how to program Swift. This book is made for complete beginners, but even the Pros need a refresher once in a while.</p>

				<h2>A Brick by Brick guide for beginners</h2>

				<p>I’ll teach you everything you need to know to make your first app, <strong>NO Programming Experience Required</strong>. The Book is almost ready and needs some well deserved feedback. Get the first 2 Chapters for Free.</p>

				<p>We focus on the foundations of the Swift Programming Language by building a real, ready to release app named Stand To Make. By the end you’ll have the skills you need to build the pieces that interest you. Programming is like playing with Lego, We build piece by piece. Most programming courses move from topic to topic too quickly to truly teach the basics. We focus on the basics of programming and the bare essentials to make an iPhone app, but we delve deep into those basics to build a solid foundation for future success.</p>

				<p>This book is small and focused as beginning courses should be.</p>

				<h2>Learn to turn code, into an app</h2>

				<p>I understand that learning to program is difficult. It was hard for me! but it doesn't have to be as hard for you. Learning the basics of programming shouldn't be like searching for every piece of the Triforce from the Legend of Zelda. I'll walk you through the basics of Swift Programming so that you don't get lost. We'll learn the important elements of programming that are often assumed as common knowledge in other programming books.</p>

				<h2>You’ll be making the App: Stand To Make</h2>

				<p>It’s a calculator. You’ll use it to calculate the amount of profit you’ll make if you sell your product for X amount every Y days You’ll get Z dollars after B fees. It’s pretty cool.</p>

				<p>Honestly the app your going to make is kinda silly, but the technology behind it is not. We build it becuase it’s easy for a beginner to understand  every piece. Remember Apps are built Piece by Piece, and so too is Programming knowledge. Understanding of the basics is essential to understanding of the complicated stuff. Once you understand the basics, the complicated stuff is just more basics. </p>

				<p>Check out the Web Version of Stand To Make at <a href="http://standtomake.com" target="_blank">standtomake.com</a>. The Web version of Stand To Make was developed by Hamish Mcpherson, you can keep up with him on twitter, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/hamstu" target="_blank">@hamstu</a>.</p>

				<p>The Stand To Make iOS app is open source, you can fork it on <a href="https://github.com/karloscarweber/StandToMake/commits/master" target="_blank">Github</a>. </p>
