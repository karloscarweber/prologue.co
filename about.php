			<h2>Prologue is Karl Oscar Weber</h2>

			<p>Prologue is a tiny company dedicated to making tiny apps and writing books about it. Seriously. Since Prologue is just me, I work on Prologue full time and love it. </p>

			<p>Prologue began when Apple's new programming language, Swift, was announced at WWDC. Seeing the opportunity to write great books for beginners I began to write what would be become my First Book, Swift Foundations. It's written specifically for students that have never programmed before.</p>

			<p>Students that want to make apps need to learn to program first, which is by far the biggest obstacle. Programming books are written poorly for beginners often assuming previous programming knowledge. The announcment of swift brought a great opportunity to make the programming book that I wish that I had when I was first starting out. So that's what I'm going to do.</p>

			<p>More books and apps to follow soon.</p>
